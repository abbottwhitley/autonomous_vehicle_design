# Module 1 - Serial Communication Between Arduino and Another Computer

A robot typically requires data transfer between its computer systems. In our case, the system will consist of an Arduino microcontroller and one other computer. The Arduino and computer are physically connected by a universal serial bus (USB) cable. The cable is the physical data transfer medium.
