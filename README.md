### Course Description
The course is designed as an introduction to autonomous mobile robotics. Each student will create a self-balancing robot that can avoid obstacles and recognize simple objects. The class is broken down into separate modules designed to learn and implement the required concepts. This building block approach is designed to aid student success in creating a working robot.

### Course Topics
- Sensing, actuation, and locomotion
- PID Control
- Velocity Control
- Data Visualization
- Obstace Avoidance
- Computer Vision 
- Telemetry

<br>

### Prerequisites
ELEC 2520 or MECH 3032. Graduate students who have not completed these undergraduate prerequisites should have prior programming experience in a functional/object-oriented programming language such as python, C/C++, java, javascript, or C#.

<br>

### Programming Languages
Assignments will require python and C/C++ programming. Prior experience with these languages is not required, but will require extra effort to learn the language syntax.

<br>

### Recommended Books

For those who do not know the python language, part I, chapters 1-11, are recommended.
